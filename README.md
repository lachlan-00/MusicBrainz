## Usage Example

```php
<?php
    use Guzzle\Http\Client;
    use MusicBrainz\Filters\ArtistFilter;
    use MusicBrainz\Filters\RecordingFilter;
    use MusicBrainz\HttpAdapters\GuzzleHttpAdapter;
    use MusicBrainz\MusicBrainz;

    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

    // Create new Guzzle HTTP client
    $config = [
        'allow_redirects' => true
    ];
    $client = new Client($config);

    // Some areas require authentication
    $username = 'username';
    $password = 'password';

    // Create new MusicBrainz object
    $brainz   = new MusicBrainz(new GuzzleHttpAdapter($client), $username, $password);
    $brainz->setUserAgent('ApplicationName', MusicBrainz::VERSION, 'https://example.com');

    try {
        // Search for Buddy Holly recordings by Weezer
        $args = array(
            "recording"  => "Buddy Holly",
            "artist"     => 'Weezer',
            "creditname" => 'Weezer',
            "status"     => 'Official'
        );

        // Search for recordings and then return a list of Recording objects
        $recordings = $brainz->search(
            new RecordingFilter($args)
        );
        print_r($recordings);
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        print $e->getMessage();
    }
    try {
        // Search for an artist by the recording ID, include the aliases, ratings and genres
        $includes = ['aliases', 'ratings', 'genres'];
        $browse   = $brainz->browseArtist(
            'recording',
            'd615590b-1546-441d-9703-b3cf88487cbd',
            $includes,
            1
        );

        // Filters are used to parse responses and return data objects    
        $artistFilter = new ArtistFilter([]);
        $genreFilter  = new GenreFilter([]);

        // artistFilter::parseResponse returns an array of Artist objects
        foreach ($artistFilter->parseResponse($browse, $brainz) as $artist) {
            // print Artist data property
            print_r($artist->getData());

            // genreFilter::parseResponse returns an array of Genre objects
            foreach ($genreFilter->parseResponse($artist->getData(), $brainz) as $genre) {
                // print each genre for the artist
                print_r($genre->getData());
            }
        }
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        print $e->getMessage();
    }
